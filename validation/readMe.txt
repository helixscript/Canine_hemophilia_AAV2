Genome to geome validation

Linus chr22-184021 5KB frag 
Clear bridging read pileup with 100 NT deletion.
Clearly full length heavy chain
bridging reads mapped to vector suggest additonal poly-A segment suggesting additional segment.


Linus chr25-34587602
Contig schematics padded by unseen genomic reads.
Bridging reads mapped to vector make sense.
slice13c -- light chain, 5' ITR + 1/4 of promotor. 
slice12b -- light chain, 5' ITR + 1/4 of promotor.


Linus chr37+13443531 
bridging reads mapped to vector make sense.
F8 not seen in contig visualization.
slice14 --  light chain, last 1/4 of F8 + ploy-A + 3' ITR.


M50 chr15-42531469 (X)
no briding reads
slice6-7a -- single chain, 5' ITR + 90% promoter


M50 chr25-34590970
Bridging reads mapped to vector make sense.
Contig visualization needs to be improved.
slice4-5a -- single chain, 5' ITR + promoter + 5% F8
slice2    -- single chain, 5' ITR + promoter + 5% F8; contig visualition suggests inversion of F8
slice1a   -- single chain, 5' ITR + promoter + 5% F8


M50 chr4+14757686
bridging reads not seen leaving promotor in vector alignment.
slice9-10d -- single chain, 5' ITR + 50% promoter
slice8a -- single chain, 5' ITR + 60% promoter

M50 chr4+14801159
No bridging reads.
dog1 -- Single light chain out to polyA + 3' ITR then some additional F8.
dog2 -- Single light chain out to polyA + 3' ITR.


M50 chr4-14757678
No bridging reads.
dog3 -- Single light chain out to polyA + 3' ITR.
dog4 -- Single 5' ITR + promoter + heavvy chain
dog5 -- Single light chain out to polyA + 3' ITR.
dog6 -- No contigs assemble


J60 chr18-48600092
Some slices contain bridging reads
dog7  -- light chain + polyA (additional mixed contigs created)
dog8  -- full length heavy chain ? (ITR -> ITR)
dog9  -- zoo of contigs
dog10 -- larger zoo of contigs
dog11 -- larger zoo of contigs
